# Explainable-AI-Vision-Assistant-for-Real-World-Events

Imagine a system that can watch a video stream (camera, phone, or dataset) and then: 

*Detect events (e.g., “a person enters a restricted zone”). 

*Explain what’s happening in plain language (“The person crossed the yellow safety line without wearing a helmet”). 

*Answer questions interactively (“Why is this dangerous?” → “Because safety rules require a helmet in construction zones”)
